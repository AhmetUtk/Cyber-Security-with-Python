Hello, when the code I aimed with this code was run, when the keys were pressed from the keyboard when the code was run, it was to record the images from the camera and receive the images recorded to the e-mail address entered. The project was successful, but in order to use the code, it will be enough to organise the necessary email addresses according to yourself and take the mail key from Google and enter it in the relevant places.
